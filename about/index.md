![Luís Ramalho](/assets/luisramalho.jpeg)

I'm interested in mobile application development, especially Android and iOS. I've started two companies, and have worked with countless programming languages.

I hold two bachelor's degrees, one in Physical Therapy (2003-2007) from [UFP](http://www.ufp.pt) and another in Computer Science (2008-2012) from the [University of St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

I live in Turku, Finland. I go 3-4x per week to the gym, and when possible I like to play squash and swim. I'm addicted to movies, I often read technical books and [travel](http://www.destinos.pt) as much as I can.
