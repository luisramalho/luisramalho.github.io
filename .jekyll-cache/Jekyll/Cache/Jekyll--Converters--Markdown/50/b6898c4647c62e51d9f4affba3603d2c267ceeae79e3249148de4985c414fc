I"µ<p>Accurate estimates are notorious difficult to make. Parkinson‚Äôs law states that ‚Äúwork expands so as to fill the
time available for its completion‚Äù (Parkinson 1968). In fact, this law might explain the reason why projects rarely
underrun. However, the major problem in many projects is that the time available for its completion is often
underestimated, thus, causing the potential cancellation or overrun of the project both in terms of time and cost.
In the sections that follow, there will be a discussion of reasons why estimates are often wrong and in another post give <a href="/ways-to-improve-estimates-for-project-times-and-costs">suggestions of ways to improve them</a>.</p>
