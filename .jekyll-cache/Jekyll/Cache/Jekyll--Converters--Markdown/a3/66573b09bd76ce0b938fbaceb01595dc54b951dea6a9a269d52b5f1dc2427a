I"Ó<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=31">Coin sums</a> is a problem where one must count how many different ways a Â£2 coin can be made using any number of coins. Firstly, I tried to tackle this problem using brute-force, as I usually go about it. However, in this particular case and because there were so many coins (aka 8), creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">for loop</code> for each and every coin was not a solution that Iâ€™d be happy with.</p>
