Acidente Vascular Cerebral is an app about stroke.

> Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is poor blood supply to the brain resulting in cell death.

My [blog](http://acidentevascularcerebral.com/) about the subject has been receiving considerable interest, thus the release of the Android app. Hopefully it will inform people about this pathology, which is the second cause of death worldwide.
