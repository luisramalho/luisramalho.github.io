[MaxProfit](https://codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/max_profit) is a problem where one must compute the maximum possible earnings given a log of stock prices. Note that before attempting this problem, you should read the material on [maximum slice](https://codility.com/media/train/7-MaxSlice.pdf).

Our goal is to basically compute the maximum profit that ends in a given position. Thus, if we assume that the maximum profit that ends in a position _i_ equals _maxProfit_ then the maximum slice ending in position _i + 1_ is going to be _max(0, maxProfit + (a<sub>i</sub> - a<sub>i - 1</sub>))_.

{% highlight java %}
int maxProfit = 0;
int maxSlice = 0;

for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
    maxProfit = Math.max(0, maxProfit + (a[i] - a[i - 1]));
    maxSlice = Math.max(maxSlice, maxProfit);
}

if (maxSlice < 0) {
    maxSlice = 0;
}

return maxSlice;
{% endhighlight %}
