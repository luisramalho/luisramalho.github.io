Comecei há uns dias a ler o "<em>The New Rules of Marketing and PR</em>" pelo David Meerman Scott (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dmscott">@dmscott</a>) e <em>so far so good</em> embora haja muito bla bla para pouco sumo.

Algumas frases que achei interessantes até agora:
<ul>
	<li>"When I arrive to a site, you don't need to grab my attention; you already have it!"</li>
	<li>"The web is different. Instead of one-way interruption, web marketing is about delivering useful content at just the precise moment a buyer needs it."</li>
	<li>"People want to participate, not propaganda."</li>
	<li>"PR is not about your boss seeing your company on TV. It's about your buyers seeing your company on the web."</li>
	<li>"Blogs, online video, e-books, news releases, and other forms of online content let organizations communicate directly with buyers in a form they appreciate."</li>
	<li>"What visitors really want is content that first describes the issues and problems they face and then provides details on how to solve those problems."</li>
</ul>

É um livro de 340 páginas, logo que o acabe deixo a minha <em>final review</em>.
