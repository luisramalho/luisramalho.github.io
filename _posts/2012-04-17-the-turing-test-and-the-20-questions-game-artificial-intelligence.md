As part of an assignment for CS3105 Artificial Intelligence I wrote an essay on The Turing Test and the 20 Questions Game.

>The Turing Test is a "simple operational definition of intelligence" and is used to test if a machine displays intelligent behaviour. Turing published the paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which explains how the "imitation game" is played, and in basic terms, there are 3 entities, one human judge, one human, and one machine, the judge tries to distinguish the human from the machine by engaging in a conversation with both of them.

>20Q is a neural network implementation of the 20 questions game which basically consists of guessing what one is thinking by asking up to 20 binary answer questions, the overall goal is to create a network similar to the human brain with synaptic connections.
