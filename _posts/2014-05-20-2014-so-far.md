My previous post was a bit more than a year, thus I reckon it is time for an update on what I have been up to.

<!-- TL;DR

Closed my company, started a master’s program. -->

#Sinemys

In September 2011 I co-founded with two other partners a web development company, and in late 2013 we decided it was time to close it.

The reasons are multiple, but the most important one was the lack of a clear mission statement. The company simply did too much.

<!-- Another might have been my lack of business skills, I was a graduate from computer science with little knowledge about business or management. -->

We signed the final closing papers this month.

##Porto.rb

Unfortunately with the departure of Sinemys, another project had to die.

I started a ruby meetup in Porto called [Porto.rb](http://www.meetup.com/porto-rb) which gathered a total of 50 great Rubyists. It is sad to see it go, and would be happy if someone takes over. Let me know.

#GITM master’s program

Life goes on, and after some reflection I have decided that I would benefit from a better understanding of IT management. Thus, I applied to the [Master's Degree Programme in Global IT Management](http://www.gitm.fi/) offered by the University of Turku, to which I was admitted.

Classes will start in the end of August.
