title: First iOS App
---

My first iOS app was just released on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dicas-para-engravidar/id960802240).

It was a very enriching experience, not only because it was my first time working with the new programming language â€” Swift, but also my first app published on the App Store. So, now I understand more about the whole process of getting an app approved.

I have the basics done, and now it's just a matter of building on top of them.

If you're interested in checking the app, you can download it by clicking on the following badge:
