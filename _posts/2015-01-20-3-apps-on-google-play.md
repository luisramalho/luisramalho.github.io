After the release of [first android app]({% post_url 2014-12-19-first-android-app-on-google-play %}) on Google Play that I've created and released another 2 android apps. They are both targetting the pregnancy market due to one of my projects called [gravidez.com](http://www.gravidez.com) which is gaining a bit of traction.

I plan to continue deepening my knowledge of Android Development in the following weeks and get started with a little of iOS Development as well. I'm really curious about Swift, it looks like an exciting language to learn.

Hopefully soon will publish my first iOS App on the App Store.
