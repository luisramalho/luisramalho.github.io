title: First Android App
---

Since I've built my [first android game]({% post_url 2012-01-08-reysoid-my-first-android-game %}) back in St. Andrews that I've been dying to get back to mobile development at full throttle. The time has come, and now I'm dedicating myself full-time to learn mobile development.

Here is the screenshot of my first app, which was built following the [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) tuturial by udacity:

The tutorial consisted on 6 lessons:

* Lesson 1: Create Project Sunshine with a Simple UI (5-8 hrs)
* Lesson 2: Connect Sunshine to the Cloud (8-10 hrs)
* Lesson 3: Create New Activities and Navigate Apps with Intents (8-10 hrs)
* Lessons 4: Use Content Providers and Loaders to Persist and Recover Data (15-20 hrs)
* Lesson 5: Implement Rich and Responsive Layouts (8-10 hrs)
* Lesson 6: Use Services and Notifications to Run in the Background (5-8 hrs)

Apart from lessons 4, the tutorial was easy to follow and the explanations were clear.

Now it's time to consolidate my knowledge and build my own first app.
