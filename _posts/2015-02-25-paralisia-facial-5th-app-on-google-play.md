Paralisia Facial is an app about facial nerve paralysis. I have a [blog](http://paralisiafacial.com/) about the subject that I've been keeping for some years now and decided to release an Android app for it.

> Facial nerve paralysis is a common problem that involves the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve.

The app only offers information at the moment, but be extended to provide a more interactive environment. One of my ideas would be to use the app as a coach for the facial exercises that are important for the recovery of the paralysis.
