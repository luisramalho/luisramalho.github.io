After finishing my [Developing Android Apps](https://udacity.com/course/ud853) tuturial, I decided that it was time to try and publish an app on Google Play. Thus, I thought a good starting point would be to use an open source project to get started, so I went ahead and created a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) app so that pregnant women can exchange messages with one another.

The result I called [Gravidez App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gravidez.messenger) and it is now published on Google Play.
