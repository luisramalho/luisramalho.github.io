It has been exactly a month since I've released [three android apps]({% post_url 2015-01-20-3-apps-on-google-play %}) on Google Play. Thus, I am very proud of saying that that number has now been incremented by one.

The new addition is a simple jokes app, where I've made use of the awesome library [Seismic](https://github.com/square/seismic) from square. In the app the user just has to shake the phone to get a new joke.
