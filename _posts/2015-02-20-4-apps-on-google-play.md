title: 4 Apps on Google Play
---

It has been exactly a month since I've released [three android apps]({% post_url 2015-01-20-3-apps-on-google-play %}) on Google Play. Thus, I am very proud of saying that that number has now been incremented by one. The new addition is a simple jokes app, where I've made use of the awesome library [Seismic](https://github.com/square/seismic) from square. I have stil la lot to add there, but the foundation is done.

I have also bought the amazing design tool from Bohemian Coding â€” Sketch 3, and improved some of the apps graphics and icons.

If you want to try the new jokes app you can get it by clicking on the badge below. A few warnings though, the jokes are in Portuguese and are still very few. Will add more later.
