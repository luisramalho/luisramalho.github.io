It has been a long time since I have posted anything in here, I have been really busy with school and now with exams my life is extra hard. Nevertheless, I will have 4 exams in January:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/?q=Current/Modules/Module-detail&modulecode=CS3103">Graphs and Algorithms</a></strong> - Algorithms, algorithm design methods, graph theory and graph algorithms, with particular applications to networking and the Internet.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/?q=Current/Modules/Module-detail&modulecode=CS3051">Software Engineering</a></strong> - This module introduces the basic concepts and theories of software engineering.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/?q=Current/Modules/Module-detail&modulecode=CS3101">Databases</a></strong> - This module covers data models, indexing techniques, query processing, database connection, transactions, concurrency and recovery. </li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/?q=Current/Modules/Module-detail&modulecode=CS3302">Data Encoding</a></strong> - Data encoding; security, secrecy, error correction and compression.</li>
</ul>

 The one that worries me the most is definitely Graphs and Algorithms, although I do not want to neglect the others in spite of it! Wish me luck :D
